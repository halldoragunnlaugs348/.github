## 💡 Philosophy  
- **Code should be readable first, clever second.**  
- **Automation is key, but not at the cost of maintainability.**  
- **The best systems are built incrementally, not overnight.**  

## 🌱 Currently Learning  
- WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance web apps  
- Advanced distributed systems patterns (e.g., CRDTs, consensus algorithms)
